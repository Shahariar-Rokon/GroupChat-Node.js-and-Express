## Introduction

Welcome to my Chatting Application! This project leverages the power of **Node.js** and simple JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive chatting platform.

Our application utilizes **Web Sockets** for real-time message broadcasting, providing a seamless communication experience. This project serves as a simple demonstration of how a real-time chatting application operates.

With this software, you can enjoy a variety of features:

- **Chat with Friends**: Connect and communicate with your friends in real-time.
- **File Sharing**: Share any files quickly and easily.
- **Multiple User Support**: Our application can support multiple users, allowing you to connect with several friends at once.
- **Instant Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly, without any delay.

Join us as we dive into real-time communication!
